# Wiki Contribution Token (WCT) System - High Level Design

## 1. System Overview

The Wiki Contribution Token (WCT) is a Solana-based incentive system designed to reward high-quality contributions to a wiki platform. The system tokenizes contributions, enables staking for additional benefits, and provides a governance mechanism for community decision-making.

### 1.1 Key Components

1. **Smart Contracts (On-chain)**
   - Token Contract: Implementation of the SPL token with tokenomics rules
   - Staking Contract: Allows token holders to lock tokens for rewards
   - Governance Contract: Enables proposal creation and voting

2. **Backend Services (Off-chain)**
   - Contribution Tracking: Records and scores wiki contributions
   - Reward Calculation: Determines token rewards based on quality and engagement
   - Authentication: Verifies user identity and wallet ownership
   - Weekly Distribution: Periodically distributes tokens based on contribution points

3. **Frontend Application**
   - Wallet Integration: Connects to Solana wallets like Phantom and Solflare
   - Contribution Dashboard: Displays user stats, points, and earnings
   - Staking Interface: Enables users to stake tokens for variable periods
   - Governance Portal: Allows users to create and vote on proposals

### 1.2 Key User Journeys

1. **Content Creation and Rewards**
   - User creates/edits wiki content
   - System assigns points based on contribution quality, user reputation, and content demand
   - Weekly distribution converts points to WCT tokens

2. **Token Staking**
   - User stakes WCT for a selected period (30/90/180/365 days)
   - User receives reputation multiplier and voting power
   - User earns staking rewards over time

3. **Governance Participation**
   - Token holder creates a proposal (requires min. 1,000 WCT staked)
   - Community votes on the proposal during voting period
   - If approved, proposal is executed after waiting period

### 2.2 Data Flow

1. **Contribution Flow**
   - User creates or edits wiki content through frontend
   - Backend API records contribution details
   - Quality assessment algorithm assigns base points
   - Points are multiplied by quality, reputation, and demand factors
   - Weekly script distributes tokens based on accumulated points

2. **Staking Flow**
   - User connects wallet and stakes tokens
   - Staking contract locks tokens for selected period
   - User receives reputation boost based on stake duration
   - Staking contract distributes rewards from transaction fees
   - After lock period, user can withdraw tokens and rewards

3. **Governance Flow**
   - User creates proposal by staking required tokens
   - Proposal data stored on-chain with execution payload
   - Users vote during voting period based on voting power
   - If quorum reached and majority approves, proposal is executable
   - After execution delay, proposal can be implemented
