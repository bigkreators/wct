# Wiki Contribution Token (WCT) Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Implementation plan for a Solana-based token reward system that incentivizes and gamifies wiki contributions through tokenized rewards, engagement incentives, and governance mechanisms.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)

### Smart Contract Development

  - Test token minting and basic transfers

- [ ] **Fee Mechanism**
  - Implement 2% transfer fee logic
  - Create distribution mechanism (20% burn, 50% treasury, 30% staking)
  - Test fee collection and distribution

### Backend Foundation
- [ ] **Database Design**
  - Design schema for tracking contributions, points, and rewards
  - Create relationships between wiki content and token economy
